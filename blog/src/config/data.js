//     "In case you love shopping for clothes or accessories but have the anxiety of having to spend a lot of time in front of the store, you may want to think of going online. These days, many stores have been offering Internet as their main marketing strategy so that they can compete with the big stores. Although shopping in the Internet is somewhat cheaper than in the mall, you will still be spending more time in front of the store. If you are planning to shop for something specific, you may want to look for a general website that offers a wide range of merchandise. Once you get familiar with the online shopping experience, you may feel that shopping in an Internet shop is more comfortable than shopping in the mall. Another reason why many people choose to shop online is because of the convenience of having all the items ready at your fingertips. You can just click the mouse and browse through the different sites of a retailer you like. Also, you can do a search or look for a particular brand and you will be given all the information about the item you are looking for right at your fingertips. On the other hand, malls offer a much bigger selection and the prices are usually cheaper than those on the Internet. They also offer the same services. However, if you want to save some money on the shopping spree, you can always consider going online. You can find a wide variety of products and everything is right at your fingertips. Another advantage of shopping in the Internet is that it is quite easy to order your products. Instead of standing in a long line at the mall, you just have to go online and simply type in the product you are looking for. You can also check for coupons and discounts, if you are looking for a gift for someone. Shopping online also offers you the option of being flexible. Instead of staying in one place or the mall, you can now shop from the comfort of your home. You can just go there if you have some extra time and when you find the item you want, you can easily purchase it without any problem. Finally, you can enjoy the convenience of being able to shop anytime, anywhere as you can use the Internet to check out the best deals. In fact, many malls have their own websites where they offer special offers and discounts. So, you can use the Internet to find a good deal without having to leave your house.",

It is also a city infested with crime with far fewer women than men, with a subsequently higher amount of violence against women. It is also an example of moral decay; the series opens with a girl being attacked in broad daylight with people apathetically passing by, remarking that she should take care of herself. Not wanting their daughter to suffer the same fate, Tsukasa Kozuki's cop parents raise and teach her to live as a boy. While Tsukasa's parents investigate the murder of her classmate's, Ryuji Shirogami's, father, who is the leader of the powerful Kuryugumi yakuza group, they are both killed in one of the yakuza's in-fights. The deaths leave both Tsukasa and Ryuji orphans, with Ryuji succeeding the group as their third generation boss, known as the Sandaime, and Tsukasa on the streets with her three brothers.",

//     "The first question I ask myself when thinking about parallel universes on a celestial level is: Why would parallel universe’s exist that form all outcomes of thought? It can’t happen because time is not a vessel that can support such a vast complex entity. The building blocks of the universe can not maintain this level of intricate detail, and why would it? The vessel to make this achievable is onboard the living entity. In this case, the human being; which has achieved an adequate level of consciousness.",

//     "Of course you can’t ignore that it is very fast and exciting, which is important because there is something naturally exhilarating about speed. Anyone who has enjoyed a roller coaster ride will testify to that. A Grand Prix car at the limit is a very spectacular thing to behold and Formula One creates a stunning display that is unique amongst sports. There is also the inherent danger, which might not be an instant attraction to motor racing but certainly makes it very unique. There are very few mainstream sports where you can die. It is also a contest where there is a clear winner. The first man across the finish line takes victory, simple as that. F1 is not a sport that relies on a judge’s scorecard so there isn’t anything subjective about the result. There isn’t an umpire whose whistle can regularly affect the outcome. Yes, penalties do apply in racing, but they are not as common as they are in other sports and are often clear cut speeding infringements. It isn’t the same as a referee having to judge the legitimacy of a player rolling around on the ground claiming to have been tripped. The very format of the Formula One World Championship also adds to its appeal. It follows the calendar year, rather than a particular season, and every event is held in a different country. At the end of it all there is a single World Champion who is crowned that year’s winner. Few other sports use such a format, which is a shame because it works very well.",

//     "The movement began in July 2013, with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin 17 months earlier in February 2012. It became nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two more African Americans, Michael Brown—resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a city near St. Louis—and Eric Garner in New York City.[11][12] Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election.[13] The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The movement returned to national headlines and gained further international attention during the global George Floyd protests in 2020 following his murder by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. An estimated 15 million to 26 million people participated in the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, making it one of the largest movements in the country's history. It comprised many views and a broad array of demands but they centered on criminal justice reform.",

//     "A cactus (pl. cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus)[3] is a member of the plant family Cactaceae,[a] a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales.[4] The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek word κάκτος (káktos), a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not certain.[5] Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Although some species live in quite humid environments, most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. Because of this, cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. For example, almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of true leaves, cacti's enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.",
